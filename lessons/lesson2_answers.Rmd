### Exercise 1

```{r, eval = FALSE}
barnyard_ghg <- read.csv('datasets/barnyard_ghg.csv')
```

### Exercise 2

One way to do this would be `glimpse(barnyard_ghg)` and `table(barnyard_ghg$Surface)`.

### Exercises 3-6

```{r, eval = FALSE}
barnyard_ghg %>%  
  filter(Temp > 10) %>%
  group_by(Surface) %>%
  summarize(mean_CO2 = mean(CO2_mgC), mean_CH4 = mean(CH4_mgC), mean_NH3 = mean(NH3_ugN), mean_N2O = mean(N2O_ugN)) %>%
  arrange(mean_CO2)
```

### Exercise 7

One way is:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
pivot_longer(relig_income, cols = -religion)
```

or if you want to give your own names to the newly created columns, 

```{r, eval = FALSE}
pivot_longer(relig_income, cols = -religion, names_to = 'income', values_to = 'individuals')
```
