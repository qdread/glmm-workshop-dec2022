We can include continuous effects, categorical effects, and interactions between any of them. Notice that I've written 

```{r}
fit_temp <- lm(CO2_mgC ~ Temp, data = barnyard_ghg)
fit_surfacetemp <- lm(CO2_mgC ~ Surface + Temp, data = barnyard_ghg)
fit_int <- lm(CO2_mgC ~ Surface + Temp + Surface:Temp, data = barnyard_ghg)
fit_int_shortcut <- lm(CO2_mgC ~ Surface*Temp, data = barnyard_ghg)
```
