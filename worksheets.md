title: Worksheets and Example Datasets

## If you are using Posit Cloud to access RStudio

When you open the workspace, you will see folders called `datasets` and `worksheets` in the "Files" tab of the lower right pane of the RStudio window. You can click on those folders to browse through them and open the files. There is no need to download anything. 

I recommend saving a copy of the worksheets

## If you are running RStudio locally

You will need to download the datasets and worksheets. Here they are as .zip files:

[datasets.zip](xxx){: .biglink }  
[worksheets.zip](xxx){: .biglink }

Unzip the file
