title: Pre-workshop learning materials
---

These are some resources you can take a look at to brush up on your R or statistical modeling before the workshop. *These are all optional!* No pressure to look at any of these, but some of you might find them helpful. 

I've divided this resources page into two sections: one with resources about [learning how to code in R](#learning-R) and one with resources about [mixed models](#learning-mixed-models) but there is a lot of overlap.

**I will add more resources to this list later. Please check back soon!**

## Learning R

[R for Data Science](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/){: .biglink }

This is a book on using the "tidyverse" family of R packages to work with data in R. We will be using some of the tidyverse packages in the workshop. It is available in ebook and print form. It is a great introduction to the kinds of data we will be working with: how to make simple plots, clean and manipulate the data, and even gets into the very basics of statistical modeling.

[USDA SciNet's list of free online R training courses](https://scinet.usda.gov/training/free-online-training){: .biglink }

This is a list of free online tutorials, many available through AgLearn, on R. Many of them cover statistical models including linear mixed models. Shout-out to my fellow ARS statisticians Sara and Kathy, who compiled this list of resources!

[SESYNC Cyberhelp lessons](https://sesync-ci.github.io/lesson/){: .biglink }

These are tutorials on data science for researchers including a lot of lessons on R and a few on statistics. I helped develop many of these lessons in my previous job at SESYNC. I would highly recommend the "Basic R", "Tidy Data in R", "Plots in R", "Model Formulas", and "Advanced Tidyverse" as the most relevant ones for this workshop.

[UCLA Stats Consulting's page of R resources](https://stats.oarc.ucla.edu/r/){: .biglink }

The stats consultants at UCLA do a great job putting together tutorials, lessons, and examples on statistics using R. (For SAS users, they also have a nice page of SAS lessons and examples: https://stats.oarc.ucla.edu/sas/).

## Learning mixed models

[Animated visualization of mixed models](http://mfviz.com/hierarchical-models/){: .biglink }

This simple visualization does an amazing job explaining what mixed models are.

[Basic tutorial on mixed models in R](https://ourcodingclub.github.io/tutorials/mixed-models/){: .biglink }

A brief and accessible introduction.

[Mixed models for agriculture in R](https://schmidtpaul.github.io/MMFAIR/){: .biglink}

This is a lot more technical in terms of the statistics compared with other resources I've posted here, but it is very relevant to agricultural data analysis.
