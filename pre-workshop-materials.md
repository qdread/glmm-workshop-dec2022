These are some resources you can take a look at to brush up on your R or statistical modeling before the workshop. *These are all optional!* No pressure to look at any of these, but some of you might find them helpful.

**I will add more resources to this list later. Please check back soon!**

## R for Data Science

This is a book on using the "tidyverse" family of R packages to work with data in R. We will be using some of the tidyverse packages in the workshop. It is available in ebook and print form. It is a great introduction to the kinds of data we will be working with: how to make simple plots, clean and manipulate the data, and even gets into the very basics of statistical modeling.

## SciNet's list of free online R training courses

This is a list of free online tutorials, many available through AgLearn, on R. Many of them cover statistical models including linear mixed models. Shout-out to my fellow ARS statisticians who compiled this list of resources!

## SESYNC Cyberhelp lessons

These are tutorials on data science for researchers including a lot of lessons on R and a few on statistics. I helped develop many of these lessons in my previous job at SESYNC. I would highly recommend the "Basic R", "Tidy Data in R", "Plots in R", "Model Formulas", and "Advanced Tidyverse" as the most relevant ones for this workshop.

## UCLA Stats

The stats consultants at UCLA do a great job putting together tutorials, lessons, and examples on statistics using R. (For SAS users, they also have a nice page of SAS lessons and examples: https://stats.oarc.ucla.edu/sas/).

## Mixed models for agriculture in R

This is a lot more technical in terms of the statistics compared with other resources I've posted here, but it is very relevant to agricultural data analysis.

## Animated visualization of mixed models

This simple visualization does an amazing job explaining what mixed models are.
