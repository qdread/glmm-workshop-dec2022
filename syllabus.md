## Conceptual learning objectives

At the end of the workshop, students will be able to . . . 

-	Conceptually understand all components of a linear mixed model (LMM), including: 
  +	Fixed effects
  +	Random intercepts and random slopes
  +	Estimated marginal means
- Understand the difference between a linear mixed model (LMM) and generalized linear mixed model (GLMM)
-	Interpret the output of a LMM and GLMM

## Practical learning objectives

At the end of the workshop, students will be able to . . .

- Read data into R
- Do simple manipulations of R data frames
- Use the R modeling package **lme4** to fit LMM and GLMM models
-	Generate predictions from a fitted model, including estimated marginal means
-	Test specific hypotheses with contrasts

## R packages we will learn about

-	“tidyverse” packages especially **readr**, **dplyr**, and **tidyr** (read and manipulate data)
-	**lme4** (fit models)
- **lmerTest** (do ANOVA tests on mixed models)
- **easystats** (make diagnostic plots to test model assumptions)
-	**emmeans** (estimate treatment effects and test hypotheses)
-	**ggplot2** (make publication-quality graphics)
